I'm not ready to develop this project currently. I'm studying at [curso.dev](https://curso.dev) and working on the [clone-tabnews](https://github.com/leomenezesdel/clone-tabnews) repository.

This project will be organic and take it step by step. So, if you have some interest in it, watch my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leomenezesdel/) and [TabNews blog](https://www.tabnews.com.br/leomenezes).
